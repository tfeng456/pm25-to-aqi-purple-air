# PM2.5 to AQI Conversion for Purple Air Data
Script gives a table of daily AQI values by converting averaged PM 2.5 data to AQI values. Uses Purple Air data exports.

This script was created to be used in a data visualization dashboard and data management web tool by Data4Good. The tool was made for displaying and analyzing air sensor data in Los Angeles for Coalition for Clean Air (a clean air advocacy group :leaves:).

During the project, I was able to:
* Design and build a prototype for a data management and data visualization web tool for air sensor data for the Coalition for Clean Air.
* Work with an interdisciplinary team and learn about all aspects of product development and the design thinking process.
* Develop R scripts for the tool that would convert Particulate Matter concentration into an Air Quality Index value, taking into account how such values should be calculated and handled.

This script was made to be used with the .csv files downloaded from [Purple Air's website](https://www.purpleair.com/sensorlist?) and works with the format of the .csv files as of 08-17-2020.
