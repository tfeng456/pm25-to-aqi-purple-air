# PM2.5 to AQI Conversion for Purple Air Data
Script gives a table of daily AQI values by converting averaged PM 2.5 data to AQI values. Uses Purple Air data exports.

This script was created to be used in a data visualization dashboard and data management web tool by Data4Good. The tool was made for displaying and analyzing air pollution data in Los Angeles for Coalition for Clean Air (a clean air advocacy group :leaves:).

This script was made to be used with the .csv files downloaded from [Purple Air's website](https://www.purpleair.com/sensorlist?) and works with the format of the .csv files as of 08-17-2020.
